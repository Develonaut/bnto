# Bnto — Build Plan

**Last Updated:** March 2, 2026
**This is the single source of truth for what's been built, what's in progress, and what's next.**

Skills and commands that reference the plan read this file. Update it after every sprint.

---

## How This Works

Tasks are organized into **sprints** (features) and **waves** (dependency groups within a sprint). All tasks in a wave can be picked up in parallel by agents. Waves must complete in order before the next wave starts.

```
- [ ]              → available, grab it
- [ ] **CLAIMED**  → an agent is working on this, pick something else
- [x]              → done
```

**Scope rule:** Each task targets ONE package. Don't touch files outside the tagged package unless the task explicitly says so.

**Sprint branches:** Each active sprint gets a long-lived branch (`sprint/<id>-<short-name>`, e.g. `sprint/3-platform-features`). Task branches are created from and PR'd back to the sprint branch — not `main`. When a sprint completes, one PR merges the sprint branch into `main` (single deploy). This prevents Vercel deployment rate-limiting from per-task merges. The user creates sprint branches manually — if one doesn't exist yet for the current sprint, ask the user to create it or confirm you should.

**Co-location decision (Feb 2026):** UI components and editor features live in `apps/web` for now. No separate `@bnto/ui` or `@bnto/editor` packages until there's a real second consumer (desktop app). Engine, core API, and data layer logic stays in `@bnto/core`. When the UI package is extracted, it will be published as `@bnto/ui` (npm) under the name **Motorway** — the Mini Motorways-inspired design system (surface, elevation, pressable, spring animations, warm palette).

## Revenue & Monetization Context

Pricing, revenue projections, and "ready to charge" criteria live in Notion ("SEO & Monetization Strategy").

**Monetization model (updated Feb 2026):** Browser execution is free unlimited. Pro sells real value — persistence, collaboration, premium compute. See ROADMAP.md for the full model.

| Sprint | What Ships | Revenue Implication |
|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| Sprint 2B | Browser execution (M1 MVP) | **All Tier 1 bntos run client-side.** Zero backend cost. Files never leave user's machine. |
| Sprint 2C | Launch readiness (content + domain) | **bnto.io live and indexable.** Real content on every page. SEO crawling begins. First real users possible. |
| Sprint 2D | Recipe page UX overhaul | **COMPLETE.** Progressive phase-driven flow. Motorway design language on every tool page. |
| Sprint H | Housekeeping | **COMPLETE.** FileUpload rewrite, Rust test audit, EXIF coverage, Pressable, CI, ESLint. |
| Sprint 3 | Platform features (accounts, history) | Accounts exist. Conversion hooks scaffolded (Save, History). Usage analytics instrumented. |
| Sprint 4 | Recipe editor (headless + visual) | Power users self-identify. Create/customize recipes = highest-intent Pro signal. Free editor fosters community recipe ecosystem. |
| Sprint 5-6 | Desktop app | Top-of-funnel. Word of mouth begins. Free forever — trust signal. |
| Sprint 7 | Stripe + Pro tier | **First revenue possible.** Pro: $8/month for persistence, collaboration, server-side AI, priority processing. |

---

### Sprint 3A: Remove Anonymous User System

**Goal:** Eliminate the anonymous Convex session system. The model becomes binary: you're signed in or you're not. No invisible Convex users, no anonymous→real upgrade flow. Browser execution is free unlimited without any server-side session.

**Why now:** The anonymous system added complexity to every layer (schema, auth, core hooks, UI, tests) without serving any current product goal. Removing it before Sprint 3 Wave 2 (dashboard, conversion hooks) prevents building new features on top of dead infrastructure.

**What stays:** `@convex-dev/auth` password provider, session cookies, proxy route protection, sign-in/sign-up/sign-out flows. The auth system itself is fine — we're only removing the anonymous session layer on top of it.

**Persona ownership:**
| Package | Persona |
|---------|---------|
| `@bnto/backend` | `/backend-engineer` |
| `@bnto/core` | `/core-architect` |
| `@bnto/auth` | `/backend-engineer` |
| `apps/web` | `/frontend-engineer` |
| `.claude/` docs | No specific persona |

#### Wave 1 (backend — schema + auth simplification)

Strip anonymous plumbing from the data layer. This is the foundation — everything else depends on schema being clean.

- [x] `@bnto/backend` — Remove anonymous auth provider from `convex/auth.ts`. Keep only password provider. Simplify `convex/_helpers/user_lifecycle.ts`
- [x] `@bnto/backend` — Schema cleanup: remove `isAnonymous`, quota fields, `by_anonymous` index from users table
- [x] `@bnto/backend` — Simplify `convex/execution_events.ts` to require userId on all execution events
- [x] `@bnto/backend` — Delete anonymous test files. Update remaining tests to remove anonymous scenarios
- [x] `@bnto/backend` — **Validation:** `task ui:test` passes for `@bnto/backend`. All remaining tests green

#### Wave 2 (core — hooks + types + adapters)

Remove anonymous hooks and types from `@bnto/core`. This is the transport-agnostic API layer — clean it so the web app has a simple auth surface.

- [x] `@bnto/core` — Delete anonymous/quota hooks. Remove exports from `reactCore.ts`
- [x] `@bnto/core` — Simplify `useSignUp.ts` and `useAuth.ts`. Auth state is binary
- [x] `@bnto/core` — Clean types and transforms: remove `isAnonymous` and quota fields
- [x] `@bnto/core` — Delete anonymous integration tests. Update remaining tests
- [x] `@bnto/core` — **Validation:** `task ui:test` passes for `@bnto/core`. All remaining tests green

#### Wave 3 (web — components + auth flow)

Remove anonymous UI patterns from the web app. Simplify auth page, remove gate components, clean up providers.

- [x] `apps/web` — Delete `UpgradePrompt.tsx`. **AccountGate retained** — it's the primary conversion component for enticing unauthenticated users to create accounts. Used on `/my-recipes` and available for any gated surface
- [x] `apps/web` — Simplify providers, NavUser, SignInForm: remove anonymous session handling
- [x] `apps/web` — Simplify recipe flow: browser execution is always allowed, no gates
- [x] `apps/web` — **Validation:** `task ui:build` passes. No TypeScript errors from removed types/hooks

#### Wave 4 (auth E2E — verify the simplified system)

Comprehensive E2E tests proving the simplified auth model works end-to-end. Every user-facing flow tested.

- [x] `apps/web` — Delete `anonymous-conversion.spec.ts` E2E test file
- [x] `apps/web` — **E2E: New user journey** — fresh visitor → /signin defaults to signup mode → fill form → create account → lands on home → user menu shows email → sign out → stays on /signin (no bounce)
- [x] `apps/web` — **E2E: Returning user journey** — /signin shows "Welcome back" → sign in → lands on home → user menu shows email → can access protected routes
- [x] `apps/web` — **E2E: Sign-out round-trip** — sign up → home → sign out → /signin → sign back in → home → user menu shows same email
- [x] `apps/web` — **E2E: Route protection** — unauthenticated user hits /executions → redirected to /signin. Authenticated user hits /signin → redirected to /. Sign out → protected routes blocked again
- [x] `apps/web` — **E2E: Browser execution without account** — visit recipe page (e.g. /compress-images) with no account → drop files → run → execution completes → download works. No sign-up prompt blocking the flow
- [x] `apps/web` — **E2E: Form toggle** — signup ↔ signin toggle works. Invalid credentials show error. Duplicate email on signup signs in existing user
- [x] `apps/web` — **Validation:** All E2E tests pass (13/13 auth, screenshots regenerated). Test account cleanup via global teardown

#### Wave 5 (docs + cleanup)

Update all documentation and strategy files to reflect the simplified auth model. Remove references to anonymous users, quotas, and conversion funnels that no longer exist.

- [x] `.claude/` — Update `PLAN.md`, `pricing-model.md`, `auth-routing.md`, `environment-variables.md` to remove anonymous references
- [x] `.claude/` — Update journey docs: `journeys/auth.md` (remove anonymous conversion rows)
- [x] `.claude/` — Update persona skills that reference anonymous patterns: `backend-engineer`, `security-engineer`, `security-review`
- [ ] `@bnto/backend` — Production schema cleanup: mutation to delete orphaned anonymous user records, then deploy strict schema removing the optional fields
- [ ] **Validation:** `task check` passes (full quality gate). Grep verification confirms no dead references

---

### Sprint 3: Platform Features (M2)
**Goal:** Accounts earn their keep. Users who sign up get persistence, history, and a reason to stay. Conversion hooks are natural — Save, History, Server Nodes — not artificial run caps. See [pricing-model.md](strategy/pricing-model.md) for the full free vs premium framework.

**Sprint branch:** `sprint/3-platform-features`

**Prerequisite:** Sprint 3A (anonymous user removal) must be complete. The anonymous system is gone — auth is binary (signed in or not). Conversion prompts are value-driven.

**Persona ownership:**
| Package | Persona |
|---------|---------|
| `@bnto/backend` | `/backend-engineer` |
| `@bnto/core` | `/core-architect` |
| `apps/web` | `/frontend-engineer` |
| `infra` | No specific persona — general |

#### Pre-work — COMPLETE
~~Anonymous→password userId fix~~, FIXME cleanup, privacy policy rewrite, README review, Knip dead code audit (14 files, 11 deps), naming audit, codebase standards review (149 violations), schema analytics fields, site navigation E2E tests.

#### Wave 1 (parallel — core hooks + UI components + infra decisions)

- [x] `@bnto/core` — `/core-architect` — `useExecutionHistory()` hook (paginated, per-user)
- [x] `@bnto/core` — `/core-architect` — `useUsageAnalytics()` hook (total runs, most-used bntos, last activity)
- [x] `apps/web` — `/frontend-engineer` — RecipeCard component (name, node count, last run status, last updated)
- [x] `apps/web` — `/frontend-engineer` — StatusBadge component (pending, running, completed, failed)
- [x] `apps/web` — `/frontend-engineer` — EmptyState component (no workflows yet)
- [x] `infra` — **Analytics layer decision:** PostHog selected. Decision doc at `.claude/decisions/analytics.md`. Privacy policy updated to remove premature "no tracking" promises. Copy across FAQ, pricing, hero updated to be honest, not aspirational.
- [x] `@bnto/core` — `/core-architect` — **PostHog telemetry integration:** `core.telemetry` namespace (client → adapter), `TelemetryProvider` with config injection, E2E test hook via `window.__bnto_telemetry__`. Production-only env vars (Vercel). 2 E2E tests.
- [x] `infra` — **SEO validation tooling:** Lighthouse CI in GitHub Actions (advisory, all 10 public routes). `task seo:audit` for local audits. Google Search Console verified via Cloudflare DNS. `@lhci/cli` installed as dev dep.

#### Wave 2 (parallel — dashboard + auth behavior)

- [x] `apps/web` — `/frontend-engineer` — Dashboard page (`/my-recipes`): saved workflows, recent executions, usage stats, Recent/Saved tabs, sign-up conversion prompt for unauthenticated users
- [ ] **CLAIMED** `@bnto/core` + `apps/web` — `/core-architect` + `/frontend-engineer` — **Browser-local execution history:** IndexedDB adapter in `@bnto/core` for unauthenticated users. Core routes internally — `core.executions.useHistory()` returns data regardless of auth state, web app never knows if it came from Convex or IndexedDB. 10-entry cap, oldest rotated out. Stores: slug, timestamp, status, duration. Foundation for AccountGate conversion. **This is the dependency for execution history tab and save prompt.**
- [ ] **CLAIMED** `apps/web` — `/frontend-engineer` — **Execution history tab in `/my-recipes`** (no standalone `/executions` route). List of past runs with status. Re-run for authenticated users only. Three-tier access per Feature Funnel (Notion): unauth=read-only browser-local, free=7-day server-synced with re-run, pro=30-day. Consumes `core.executions.useHistory()` — doesn't know about storage backend. **Depends on browser-local history task above.**
- [ ] **CLAIMED** `apps/web` — `/frontend-engineer` — **Save prompt** (conversion hook): After successful browser execution for unauthenticated users, surface AccountGate with save-focused copy — "Want to save this recipe? Sign up — it's free." Natural value moment, not a blocking gate. **Depends on browser-local history task.**
- [ ] **CLAIMED** `apps/web` — `/frontend-engineer` — **Browser auth behavior verification:** Token expiry, sign-out invalidation, cookie-based default mode (moved from Sprint 2A Wave 5)
- [x] `apps/web` — `/frontend-engineer` — Pricing page update: Free vs Pro side-by-side comparison (persistence, collaboration, premium compute)
- [ ] **CLAIMED** `apps/web` — `/frontend-engineer` — **Data fetching & skeleton audit:** Scan all existing components in `apps/web/` for violations of the co-located query pattern, prop drilling, mismatched skeletons, missing skeletons, separate `*Skeleton.tsx` files (for simple cases), transforms outside `select`, and loading wrapper anti-patterns. Fix violations in-place. Reference: [data-fetching-strategy.md](strategy/data-fetching-strategy.md), [skeletons.md](rules/skeletons.md)

#### Wave 3 (sequential — test)

- [ ] `apps/web` — `/frontend-engineer` — Playwright E2E: AccountGate conversion flow — unauthenticated user sees gated content with sign-up prompt on dashboard/history surfaces
- [ ] `apps/web` — `/frontend-engineer` — Playwright E2E: browser-local execution history shows recent runs for unauthenticated users; authenticated users see Convex-backed history
- [ ] `@bnto/backend` — `/backend-engineer` — Unit tests for execution analytics queries

---

### Sprint 4: Recipe Editor (Headless-First)
**Goal:** Users can create recipes from a blank canvas or customize existing ones — add/remove/configure nodes, run, and export as `.bnto.json`. The editor is free (pricing-model.md: "recipe editor is free"). Power users who create custom recipes are the highest-intent Pro upgrade candidates.

**Sprint branch:** `sprint/4-recipe-editor`

**Architecture: headless-first.** The editor is built as layers. Logic lives in pure functions, a state machine, and hooks — no visual dependency. The bento box visual (compartment cards on a grid) is one skin; the code editor (CodeMirror 6) is another. Both are views of the same `Definition` in the shared store. Users can switch between them on the fly. See [editor-architecture.md](.claude/strategy/editor-architecture.md) for the shared layer design and [visual-editor.md](.claude/strategy/visual-editor.md) for the bento box visual editor.

```
@bnto/nodes (types, schemas, validation)      ← already built
         ↓
Pure functions (definition CRUD, adapters)     ← Wave 1
         ↓
Editor store (Zustand — headless operations)   ← Wave 2
         ↓
React hooks (reactive bindings)                ← Wave 2
         ↓
Dumb components (BentoCanvas / CodeEditor)     ← Wave 3+
```

**Two entry points, same state:** `createBlankDefinition()` (empty bento box) or `loadRecipe(slug)` (pre-assembled recipe from `@bnto/nodes`). Both produce the same `EditorState` shape — same operations, same output, same visual.

**Prior art:** Atomiton's `createFieldsFromSchema` pattern. Define node parameter schemas once (`@bnto/nodes/schemas/`), auto-derive config panel UI. ~70-80% of fields need zero UI code. Already built in `@bnto/nodes` — schemas exist for all 10 node types with `visibleWhen`, `requiredWhen`, enum values, min/max, and defaults.

**What this is NOT:** Save to Convex (Sprint 3 prerequisite), execution history, workflow versioning, container node nesting (group/loop as visual sub-canvases), or the JSON/code editor (Sprint 4B — CodeMirror 6, shares the headless store but is a distinct coding-oriented experience with its own persona). Those layer on naturally once the headless foundation exists.

**Persona ownership:**
| Wave | Lead Persona | Supporting | Rationale |
|------|-------------|------------|-----------|
| Wave 1 | — (pure functions, no persona needed) | — | `@bnto/nodes` pure functions — framework-agnostic, no React or ReactFlow dependency |
| Wave 2 | `/reactflow-expert` | — | Zustand store wraps ReactFlow's change/apply pattern. Definition ↔ Flow adapters are the core seam. ReactFlow Expert owns all graph state management and adapter design |
| Wave 3 | `/reactflow-expert` + `/frontend-engineer` | — | ReactFlow Expert owns canvas interaction, connection validation, drag-and-drop. Frontend Engineer owns component composition (RecipeEditor, EditorToolbar, NodeConfigPanel, NodePalette), theming (Motorway tokens), and animation (Animate.* API) |
| Wave 4 | `/reactflow-expert` + `/frontend-engineer` | — | ReactFlow Expert maps execution state to node visual state on canvas. Frontend Engineer handles progress UI patterns and E2E test composition |

**Rule:** For ANY work touching ReactFlow APIs, graph state, canvas interaction, or the Definition ↔ Flow adapter layer — invoke `/reactflow-expert`. This persona is THE authority on `@xyflow/react` in this codebase. When visual skin work begins (Wave 3+), invoke BOTH `/reactflow-expert` AND `/frontend-engineer` together.

#### Wave 1 (parallel — headless definition operations)

Pure functions that manipulate `Definition` trees. No React, no store, no UI. Fully testable in isolation. These are the atomic operations the editor performs.

- [x] `@bnto/nodes` — **`createBlankDefinition()`**: Returns a minimal valid `Definition` — root group node with one input port and one output port, no children. The "blank canvas" entry point.
- [x] `@bnto/nodes` — **`addNode(definition, nodeType, position?)`**: Inserts a new child node into the root group with default parameters from the schema. Auto-generates unique ID, creates default ports from `NODE_TYPE_INFO`. Returns new `Definition` (immutable — never mutate).
- [x] `@bnto/nodes` — **`removeNode(definition, nodeId)`**: Removes a node and all edges connected to it. Returns new `Definition`.
- [x] `@bnto/nodes` — **`updateNodeParams(definition, nodeId, params)`**: Merges new parameter values into a node's `parameters` object. Validates against `NodeSchema` (type checks, required fields, enum values, min/max). Returns new `Definition` or validation errors.
- [x] `@bnto/nodes` — **`moveNode(definition, nodeId, position)`**: Updates a node's `position`. Returns new `Definition`.
- [x] `@bnto/nodes` — **`definitionToRecipe(definition, metadata?)`**: Wraps a `Definition` into a `Recipe` with slug, name, description, accept spec. For export.
- [x] `@bnto/nodes` — **Unit tests for all CRUD operations**: Every function tested with all 10 node types. Edge cases: remove node (clean removal), update params with invalid values (validation errors), blank definition is valid, move node to new position, nested container operations.

#### Wave 2 (parallel — editor store + React hooks)

Zustand store that wraps the pure functions into a reactive state machine. Hooks provide the React binding layer. Still headless — no visual components. **`/reactflow-expert` leads** — owns the Definition ↔ Bento adapter design and Zustand store architecture.

- [x] `apps/web` — **`useEditorStore` (Zustand)**: Editor state: `definition` (current `Definition`), `selectedNodeId`, `isDirty`, `validationErrors[]`, `executionState` (per-node status map). Actions: `loadRecipe(slug)`, `createBlank()`, `addNode(type)`, `removeNode(id)`, `selectNode(id)`, `updateParams(nodeId, params)`, `moveNode(...)`, `resetDirty()`. All actions delegate to Wave 1 pure functions. Undo/redo via history stack (store snapshots).
- [x] `apps/web` — **`useEditorNode(nodeId)` hook**: Returns node data + schema + visible params (conditional visibility resolved). Subscribes to store slice — re-renders only when this node changes.
- [x] `apps/web` — **`useNodePalette()` hook**: Returns available node types from `NODE_TYPE_INFO`, grouped by category, with `browserCapable` flags. Filters server-only nodes based on context (browser editor = browser-capable only).
- [x] `apps/web` — **`useEditorExport()` hook**: Returns `{ exportAsRecipe, download }` — wraps current definition as a `Recipe` or triggers browser `.bnto.json` file download. Validates definition before export. Pure serialization — no visual dependency.
- [x] `apps/web` — **Definition ↔ Bento adapters**: `definitionToBento(definition)` → `{ nodes: CompartmentNodeType[] }`. `bentoToDefinition(nodes)` → `Definition`. Pure functions that bridge the headless model to the visual layer. Map node types to compartment variants, positions, and sizes. No edges — execution order derived from compartment position. Unit tested — round-trip: `definition → bento → definition` produces equivalent output.
- [x] `apps/web` — **Unit tests for store + hooks**: Store operations tested via Vitest (no rendering). Hook tests via `renderHook`. Adapter round-trip tests. Undo/redo verification.

#### Wave 3 (visual canvas integration — recommended order below)

Wire the headless store to the bento box canvas. The compartment grid becomes a live, interactive editor. **`/reactflow-expert` + `/frontend-engineer` co-lead.** ReactFlow Expert owns canvas interaction and node positioning. Frontend Engineer owns component composition, theming, and animation.

**Recommended execution order:** Tasks are logically parallel but have natural dependencies. Work in this order: (1) Extract shared components → (2) Enable interactive canvas → (3) Toolbar, Palette, ConfigPanel in parallel → (4) RecipeEditor composition → (5) Motorway debug wiring.

- [x] `apps/web` — **Motorway showcase component sharing**: When the visual editor ships, ensure `StationNode`, `ConveyorEdge`, and `ConveyorCanvas` become shared components imported by BOTH the Motorway showcase (`app/(dev)/motorway/`) and the production visual editor from the same location. Currently these live only in the showcase directory — they must be extracted to a shared location (e.g., `components/editor/` or alongside the editor canvas) so the showcase demonstrates real components, not stale copies. Same applies to `CompartmentNode` and `BentoCanvas`. **Rule: the Motorway page must never render fake/mock versions of components that exist in production — it imports the real thing or it doesn't show it.**
- [ ] `apps/web` — **Enable canvas interaction**: Upgrade `BentoCanvas` to accept an `interactive` prop. When `true`: `nodesDraggable={true}`, `elementsSelectable={true}`. Node drag updates position via `moveNode`. Selection dispatches `selectNode`. No edge connections — execution order is positional. When `false`: current read-only showcase behavior (backward compatible).
- [ ] `apps/web` — **`EditorToolbar` component**: Action bar above canvas — recipe selector dropdown (all Tier 1 recipes + "Blank"), Add Node button (opens palette), Remove Selected button, Run button, Reset/Replay button, Export `.bnto.json` button, Undo/Redo buttons. Reads/dispatches to `useEditorStore`.
- [ ] `apps/web` — **`NodePalette` component**: Slide-out panel listing available node types from `useNodePalette()`. Click-to-add (adds compartment at next available slot). Grouped by category. Browser-capable badge. Server-only nodes shown grayed with "Pro" badge (visible but not addable in browser context — definitions always available per pricing model).
- [ ] `apps/web` — **`NodeConfigPanel` component**: Side panel that renders when a compartment is selected. Uses `useEditorNode(selectedNodeId)` to get schema + current params. Auto-generates form fields from `ParameterSchema` (Atomiton pattern): string → text input, number → number input with min/max, boolean → toggle, enum → select dropdown. `visibleWhen` and `requiredWhen` handled reactively. Parameter changes dispatch `updateParams` to store.
- [ ] `apps/web` — **`RecipeEditor` component**: Composes `EditorToolbar` + `BentoCanvas` + `NodeConfigPanel`. Reads from `useEditorStore`. Two entry modes: `<RecipeEditor slug="compress-images" />` (loads predefined) or `<RecipeEditor />` (blank canvas). Includes `EditorModeToggle` to switch between visual (bento) and code (CM6) editors.
- [ ] `apps/web` — **Motorway debug section**: Replace the hardcoded `BentoBoxShowcase` in `/motorway` with `<RecipeEditor />`. The Motorway page becomes the editor playground — load recipes, add/remove compartments, configure parameters, run, export.

#### Wave 4 (parallel — execution + polish)

The editor runs recipes and shows execution state on the canvas. Compartments visually reflect processing progress — each lights up as it processes, then settles as the next activates. **`/reactflow-expert` + `/frontend-engineer` co-lead.**

- [ ] `apps/web` — **Execution integration**: Wire Run button to browser WASM execution path. When running: compartments show execution state (idle → pending → active → completed) via status-driven elevation changes and variant color shifts. Progress callbacks from `browserExecutionService` update `executionState` in editor store.
- [ ] `apps/web` — **Export `.bnto.json`**: Download button in toolbar that serializes current editor state to a valid `.bnto.json` file via `useEditorExport().download()`. Validates before export. Users can take their recipe anywhere — CLI, desktop, share with others.
- [ ] `@bnto/backend` — **Tag editor users**: When a user opens the editor, set `hasUsedEditor: true` on their user record. Highest-intent Pro upgrade candidates. Query: `ctx.db.query("users").withIndex("by_hasUsedEditor")`.
- [ ] `apps/web` — **E2E tests**: Load recipe → canvas renders matching compartments. Add node → compartment appears in next slot. Remove node → compartment removed, remaining reflow. Configure params → node updates. Export → valid `.bnto.json` file. Run → execution progress shown on compartments. Blank canvas → add nodes → build a recipe from scratch.

### Sprint 4B: Code Editor (CodeMirror 6)

**Goal:** A schema-aware `.bnto.json` code editor for power users — the coding-oriented counterpart to the visual canvas. Users who prefer code get the same power as the visual canvas, with the speed and precision of text editing. Slash commands bring Notion-like ergonomics. The code editor is free (same as the visual editor).

**Sprint branch:** TBD — will be created when Sprint 4B begins.

**Required reading:** Before picking up ANY task in Sprint 4B, read [code-editor.md](.claude/strategy/code-editor.md) — the design document covering tech choice rationale (CM6 over Monaco), architecture (headless-first + store sync), feature tiers, slash command implementation, JSON Schema strategy, CLI/TUI parallels, React integration pattern, theming, and performance considerations. Also read the persona at `.claude/skills/code-editor-expert/SKILL.md` for CM6-specific APIs, extension patterns, and gotchas.

**Architecture: headless-first + CM6.** The code editor shares Sprint 4's headless foundation (Wave 1 pure functions, Wave 2 editor store). CM6 extensions provide JSON-specific intelligence on top. Both editors are views of the same `Definition` in `useEditorStore`. See [code-editor.md § Architecture](.claude/strategy/code-editor.md) for the state flow diagram.

**Tech choice: CodeMirror 6, not Monaco.** ~40 KB gzipped vs ~2.4 MB (60x smaller). CSS variable theming (direct OKLCH integration). Native mobile support. Headless state (`EditorState` without DOM). See [code-editor.md § Tech Choice](.claude/strategy/code-editor.md) for the full comparison table and evidence (Sourcegraph, Replit, Chrome DevTools migrations).

**Key implementation patterns** (from design doc + persona):
- **React integration:** Custom `useCodeEditor` hook with `useRef`/`useEffect` — NOT `@uiw/react-codemirror`. CM6 author recommends imperative integration.
- **Theming:** CM6 `EditorView.theme()` with CSS variables (`var(--background)`, `var(--primary)`, etc.). Dark mode automatic. See [code-editor.md § Theming](.claude/strategy/code-editor.md).
- **Slash commands:** CM6 `CompletionSource` or `StateField` + `showTooltip` facet. Context-aware — only activates inside `"nodes"` arrays. See [code-editor.md § Slash Commands](.claude/strategy/code-editor.md).
- **Store sync:** `Annotation` pattern prevents sync loops between CM6 and Zustand. Debounced JSON parsing (200ms). See [code-editor.md § React Integration](.claude/strategy/code-editor.md).
- **JSON Schema:** Generated from `@bnto/nodes` types (build step), fed to `codemirror-json-schema` at runtime. See [code-editor.md § JSON Schema Strategy](.claude/strategy/code-editor.md).

**Persona ownership:**
| Wave | Lead Persona | Supporting | Rationale |
|------|-------------|------------|-----------|
| Wave 1 | — (build step, no persona needed) | — | JSON Schema generation from `@bnto/nodes` types — pure TypeScript |
| Wave 2 | `/code-editor-expert` | `/frontend-engineer` | CM6 foundation, theming, React integration. Frontend Engineer helps with component composition |
| Wave 3 | `/code-editor-expert` | — | Slash commands and command registry — pure CM6 extension work |
| Wave 4 | `/code-editor-expert` + `/frontend-engineer` | `/reactflow-expert` | Store sync, split view, command palette. ReactFlow Expert advises on store integration |
| Wave 5 | `/code-editor-expert` + `/frontend-engineer` | — | Breadcrumbs, polish, E2E tests |

**Rule:** For ANY work touching CodeMirror 6 APIs, editor extensions, slash commands, JSON Schema integration, or CM6 theming — invoke `/code-editor-expert`. This persona is THE authority on CM6 in this codebase.

**Dependencies:** Sprint 4 Wave 1 (pure functions) and Wave 2 (editor store) must complete first. The code editor consumes the shared store — it doesn't own it.

#### Wave 1 (parallel — JSON Schema generation)

Generate a JSON Schema from existing `@bnto/nodes` types. This schema drives CM6 validation, autocompletion, and hover tooltips. Generated, not hand-written — stays in sync with node definitions automatically. Pure TypeScript build step — no persona needed, but read [code-editor.md § JSON Schema Strategy](.claude/strategy/code-editor.md) before starting.

- [ ] `@bnto/nodes` — **JSON Schema generator script**: Build step that derives a JSON Schema from `ParameterSchema` objects (all 10 node types), `Definition` type structure, and `NODE_TYPE_INFO` metadata. Output: `packages/@bnto/nodes/src/generated/bnto.schema.json`. Schema includes per-node-type parameter constraints (`visibleWhen`, `requiredWhen`, enum values, min/max, defaults).
- [ ] `@bnto/nodes` — **Schema export**: Export the generated schema from the package entry point. Consumers import it as `import schema from "@bnto/nodes/schema"`.
- [ ] `@bnto/nodes` — **Unit tests for schema generation**: Verify schema validates known-good `.bnto.json` fixtures. Verify schema rejects malformed definitions. Verify per-node-type parameter constraints are present.

#### Wave 2 (parallel — CM6 foundation)

Editor component with JSON language, schema validation, autocompletion, hover tooltips, and warm theme. The core editing experience — everything else builds on this. **Invoke `/code-editor-expert`** — this persona owns all CM6 APIs, extension patterns, theming, and React integration. Also invoke `/frontend-engineer` for component composition.

- [ ] `apps/web` — **Install CM6 packages**: `@codemirror/state`, `@codemirror/view`, `@codemirror/lang-json`, `@codemirror/autocomplete`, `@codemirror/lint`, `@codemirror/commands`, `@codemirror/search`, `codemirror-json-schema`.
- [ ] `apps/web` — **`bntoTheme()` extension**: CM6 theme using CSS variables from `globals.css`. OKLCH tokens for background, foreground, primary (caret/cursor), accent (selection), muted (gutters), border, destructive (error diagnostics). Dark mode automatic via CSS variable resolution.
- [ ] `apps/web` — **`useCodeEditor(options)` hook**: Custom React hook (not `@uiw/react-codemirror`). Creates `EditorView` in `useEffect`, stores in `useRef`. Configures: `json()` language, `jsonSchema()` with bnto schema, `bntoTheme()`, standard keymap, history (undo/redo), bracket matching, code folding, line numbers. Cleanup on unmount.
- [ ] `apps/web` — **`CodeEditor` component**: Thin wrapper around `useCodeEditor`. Renders a `<div ref={containerRef} />` with proper sizing. Lazy-loaded via `next/dynamic({ ssr: false })` — CM6 needs DOM.
- [ ] `apps/web` — **Unit tests for CM6 extensions**: Theme applies correct CSS variables. Schema validation produces diagnostics for invalid JSON. Autocompletion suggests node type names and parameter names.

#### Wave 3 (parallel — slash commands + command registry)

Inline slash command menu for node template insertion — the bridge between "code editor" and "visual editor" ergonomics. **Invoke `/code-editor-expert`** — this persona owns slash command implementation (CM6 `CompletionSource` vs `StateField` + `showTooltip` approach), context-aware activation, and the command registry pattern.

- [ ] `apps/web` — **Command registry**: `EditorCommand` type with `id`, `label`, `description`, `category`, `icon`, `shortcut`, `slashTrigger`, `available`, `execute`. Registry populated from `NODE_TYPE_INFO` (one "Insert X Node" command per node type) plus editor commands (Format JSON, Validate, Run, Export). Single source of truth shared by slash menu and Cmd-K palette.
- [ ] `apps/web` — **`bntoSlashCommands()` extension**: CM6 `CompletionSource` (or `StateField` + `showTooltip` — evaluate which approach is better). Activates when user types `/` inside a `"nodes": [...]` array. Shows filterable list of node types with icons and descriptions. On selection, inserts a complete, valid node JSON block with generated ID, default params from schema, and cursor positioned at the first editable parameter.
- [ ] `apps/web` — **Node template generation**: Pure function `generateNodeTemplate(nodeType)` → formatted JSON string for a new node of the given type, with default parameter values from `ParameterSchema`. Used by both slash commands and command palette.
- [ ] `apps/web` — **Unit tests for slash commands**: Slash menu activates on `/` at valid position. Menu filters as user types. Selection inserts valid node JSON. Menu doesn't activate outside `"nodes"` array.

#### Wave 4 (parallel — store sync + command palette + split view)

Bidirectional sync between code editor and visual canvas. Cmd-K palette for app-level commands. Split view for simultaneous editing. **Invoke `/code-editor-expert` + `/frontend-engineer`.** Code Editor Expert owns the CM6 `Annotation` sync pattern and store integration. Frontend Engineer owns component composition and split view layout. `/reactflow-expert` advises on store integration with the visual canvas.

- [ ] `apps/web` — **Store sync extension**: CM6 `updateListener` + `Annotation` pattern. Code editor changes → parse JSON → validate → update `useEditorStore.definition`. Store changes → serialize to JSON → dispatch CM6 transaction with `externalUpdate` annotation (prevents sync loop). Debounced parsing (200ms) for performance.
- [ ] `apps/web` — **Command palette (Cmd-K)**: Uses `cmdk` (shadcn/ui `Command` component). Opens on Cmd-K anywhere in the editor. Lists all commands from the command registry. Keyboard navigable, filterable. Not CM6-specific — works across the entire app.
- [ ] `apps/web` — **Split view**: Side-by-side `BentoCanvas` + `CodeEditor`, both reading from `useEditorStore`. Changes in either sync through the store. Resizable split pane. Toggle between code-only, visual-only, and split modes via `EditorModeToggle`.
- [ ] `apps/web` — **Unit tests for sync**: Code edit → store updates. Store change → CM6 document updates. External annotation prevents sync loops. Invalid JSON doesn't crash store.

#### Wave 5 (sequential — breadcrumbs, polish, E2E)

Navigation aids and full end-to-end verification. **Invoke `/code-editor-expert` + `/frontend-engineer`.** Code Editor Expert owns breadcrumb implementation (CM6 `ViewPlugin` + Lezer tree walking) and template expression hints. Frontend Engineer owns E2E test composition.

- [ ] `apps/web` — **Breadcrumb panel**: JSON path breadcrumbs above the editor showing current cursor position: `root > nodes > [0] > parameters > quality`. CM6 `ViewPlugin` watches cursor, walks Lezer parse tree. Clicking a breadcrumb segment navigates the cursor to that position.
- [ ] `apps/web` — **Format on save**: Pretty-print JSON on Cmd-S. Preserves cursor position.
- [ ] `apps/web` — **Template expression hints**: Autocomplete for `{{.INPUT_DIR}}`, `{{.item}}`, `{{index . "node-id" "port"}}` inside string values. Custom `CompletionSource` that activates inside `{{...}}` delimiters.
- [ ] `apps/web` — **E2E tests**: Open code editor → JSON renders with syntax highlighting. Type invalid JSON → error diagnostics appear. Type `/` → slash menu shows node types. Select from slash menu → valid node template inserted. Edit in code editor → visual canvas updates (split view). Edit in visual canvas → code editor updates. Cmd-K → command palette opens. Breadcrumbs show correct path. Export produces valid `.bnto.json`.

## Phase 2: Desktop App (Local Execution)

**Goal:** Free desktop app. Same React frontend, local engine execution. Free forever, unlimited runs. No account needed. Trust signal and top-of-funnel growth driver.

**Desktop tech: Tauri (Rust-native).** M1 Rust evaluation passed — one codebase for browser WASM + desktop native + CLI.

### Sprint 5: Desktop Bootstrap

**Persona ownership:**
| Package | Persona |
|---------|---------|
| `apps/desktop` | `/frontend-engineer` |
| `@bnto/core` | `/core-architect` |
| `engine` | `/rust-expert` |

#### Wave 1 (parallel — setup)

- [ ] `apps/desktop` — `/frontend-engineer` — Bootstrap Tauri desktop project
- [ ] `@bnto/core` — `/core-architect` — Implement desktop adapter (Tauri IPC bindings)
- [ ] `engine` — `/rust-expert` — Expose engine functions for desktop bindings (RunWorkflow, ValidateWorkflow, etc.)

#### Wave 2 (parallel — integration)

- [ ] `apps/desktop` — `/frontend-engineer` — Wire up native ↔ React bindings
- [ ] `@bnto/core` — `/core-architect` — Runtime detection routes to desktop adapter in native webview
- [ ] `apps/desktop` — `/frontend-engineer` — Local file browser for selecting .bnto.json files

#### Wave 3 (sequential — verify)

- [ ] `apps/desktop` — `/frontend-engineer` — Verify workflow list, edit, and save work via native bindings
- [ ] `apps/desktop` — `/frontend-engineer` — Verify runtime detection correctly identifies desktop environment

---

### Sprint 6: Local Execution

**Persona ownership:** Same as Sprint 5 — `/frontend-engineer` (desktop UI), `/core-architect` (adapter), `/rust-expert` (engine).

#### Wave 1 (parallel — execution)

- [ ] `apps/desktop` — `/frontend-engineer` — Execute workflows via Tauri bindings (all node types)
- [ ] `@bnto/core` — `/core-architect` — Execution progress streaming via Tauri adapter
- [ ] `apps/web` — `/frontend-engineer` — Execution progress component (reusable — node status, duration, logs)

#### Wave 2 (parallel — features)

- [ ] `apps/desktop` — `/frontend-engineer` — Execution results view (output data, logs, duration)
- [ ] `apps/desktop` — `/rust-expert` — shell-command node support (full local execution, no restrictions)
- [ ] `apps/desktop` — `/frontend-engineer` — Error handling and cancellation support

#### Wave 3 (sequential — build + distribute)

- [ ] `apps/desktop` — `/frontend-engineer` — Integration tests for local execution
- [ ] `apps/desktop` — `/frontend-engineer` — macOS build (.app bundle, code signing)
- [ ] `apps/desktop` — `/frontend-engineer` — Windows build (.exe)
- [ ] `apps/desktop` — `/frontend-engineer` — Linux build (AppImage)

## Phase 3: Monetization + Polish

**Goal:** Wire up payments, enforce quotas, make the product feel complete.

**"Ready to charge" gate:** Before Sprint 7, confirm: real users running browser bntos, conversion hooks built and tested (Save, History, Premium), people return voluntarily, at least one server-side bnto (AI or shell) ready for Pro tier.

### Sprint 7: Stripe + Pro Tier (M5)

**Goal:** First revenue. Pro sells real value — not artificial limits on browser-native operations.

**What Pro includes:** $8/month or $69/year. Saved workflows, execution history (30-day retention), team sharing (up to 5 members), server-side premium bntos (AI, shell, video — M4), priority processing, API access.

**What stays free forever:** All browser-capable bntos, unlimited runs, desktop app. See ROADMAP.md trust commitments.

**Persona ownership:**
| Package | Persona |
|---------|---------|
| `apps/web` | `/frontend-engineer` |
| `@bnto/backend` | `/backend-engineer` |
| `archive/api-go` | `/go-engineer` |

#### Wave 1 (parallel — payments)

- [ ] `apps/web` — `/frontend-engineer` — Stripe integration (checkout session, webhook handler, subscription sync to Convex)
- [ ] `@bnto/backend` — `/backend-engineer` — `planTier` updated on successful Stripe webhook (free → pro)
- [ ] `apps/web` — `/frontend-engineer` — Upgrade page (`/upgrade`) — pricing, Pro benefits, Stripe checkout CTA
- [ ] `apps/web` — `/frontend-engineer` — Billing management page (current plan, cancel, manage via Stripe portal)

#### Wave 2 (parallel — Pro feature gates)

- [ ] `@bnto/backend` — `/backend-engineer` — Pro feature gates: 30-day history retention, team sharing (up to 5 members), priority processing queue
- [ ] `archive/api-go` — `/go-engineer` — Server-side execution quota enforcement (applies to premium server-side bntos only — AI, shell, video)
- [ ] `apps/web` — `/frontend-engineer` — File size enforcement at R2 presigned URL generation for server-side recipes (Pro-only, size limits TBD based on usage data)

#### Wave 3 (sequential — test)

- [ ] `apps/web` — `/frontend-engineer` — Playwright E2E: free user sees Pro conversion hooks (save, history, premium bntos)
- [ ] `apps/web` — `/frontend-engineer` — Playwright E2E: Pro user has access to saved workflows and execution history

---

### ~~Sprint 8: Visual Editor + History~~

**ABSORBED into Sprint 4 (Recipe Editor).** Sprint 4 now covers the full visual editor: headless definition CRUD, Zustand store, ReactFlow canvas, node palette, property editor, and execution state visualization. The headless-first architecture means all visual editor work builds on the same pure-function foundation.

**Remaining items not yet in Sprint 4:**
- [ ] `apps/web` — Execution history with full per-node logs and re-run support (depends on Sprint 3 accounts/history)
- [ ] `apps/web` — Workflow versioning and duplication (depends on Sprint 3 save infrastructure)
- [ ] `apps/web` — Container node visual nesting (group/loop as collapsible sub-canvases — future enhancement)
- [ ] `apps/web` — Drag-and-drop from node palette to canvas position (Sprint 4 Wave 3 uses click-to-add; drag-and-drop is a polish pass)
- [x] `apps/web` — JSON/Code editor → **Promoted to Sprint 4B** (CodeMirror 6, 5 waves, own persona `/code-editor-expert`). See Sprint 4B above.

---

## Immediate Backlog

### Infra: Convex Production Deployment Pipeline

**Priority: High.** Convex production (`gregarious-donkey-712`) was never deployed — discovered when anonymous auth started failing on bnto.io with 400 errors. `npx convex deploy --yes` and `npx @convex-dev/auth` had to be run manually. There is no automatic mechanism to deploy Convex functions to production when code merges to `main`.

- [x] `infra` — Investigate options: GitHub Actions step on merge to main, Vercel build hook (`--cmd`), or manual deploy gate
- [x] `infra` — Implement chosen mechanism so Convex prod stays in sync with main
- [x] `.claude/rules/pre-commit.md` — Add Convex deploy reminder to the push/PR workflow if manual

### Infra: PostHog Events Not Appearing in Dashboard

**Priority: High.** Recipe telemetry events (`files_added`, `recipe_run_started`, `recipe_run_completed`, etc.) are wired and verified in E2E tests via `window.__bnto_telemetry__`, but events may not be reaching the PostHog dashboard when using bnto.io in production.

- [x] `apps/web` — Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST` are set correctly on Vercel production
- [x] `apps/web` — Check if PostHog `init()` is actually called in production (DNT check, env var presence)
- [x] `apps/web` — Inspect network tab on bnto.io for PostHog requests (`/i/v0/e/` or `/decide/`)
- [x] `apps/web` — Verify events appear in PostHog Live Events view after a real compress-images run

---

## Backlog

### UX: Unified Popup/FloatingSurface Primitive

**Priority: Medium.** Dialog.Content, Menu.Content, and AccountGate all repeat the same floating surface pattern: `Card elevation="lg"` + `Animate.ScaleIn from={0.6} easing="spring-bouncier"` + pointer-events/z-index management. Extract a shared composition primitive so consumers compose it instead of duplicating the Card/animation/z-index logic.

- [ ] `apps/web` — Frontend engineer investigation: audit Dialog, Menu, AccountGate for shared patterns (animation, elevation, overlay, dismiss)
- [ ] `apps/web` — Design the primitive API — how does it compose with Radix primitives that need `asChild`? Should it handle overlays or just the floating card?
- [ ] `apps/web` — Implement `Popup` (or `FloatingSurface`) primitive in `components/ui/`
- [ ] `apps/web` — Migrate Dialog.Content, Menu.Content, and AccountGate to use the shared primitive

### UX: Compositional BouncyStagger Audit

**Priority: High.** Apply `BouncyStagger` compositionally (per-section opt-in) instead of wrapping entire `AppShell.Content` — the shell-level wrap caused a ~20px layout jump.
- [x] `apps/web` — Audit all pages using `AppShell.Content` — identify sections that benefit from staggered entrance
- [x] `apps/web` — Add `BouncyStagger` to card grids (home page BntoGallery, recipe card lists)
- [x] `apps/web` — Add `BouncyStagger` to file card lists in RecipeShell (already done in phase flow)
- [x] `apps/web` — Verify no layout shift on any page after compositional application
- [x] `apps/web` — Update Motorway showcase (`PhaseFlowShowcase`) to demonstrate the compositional pattern

### UX: Standardize Forms with React Hook Form + Zod

**Priority: Medium.** React Hook Form + Zod for traditional forms (auth, settings). Decision doc: [decisions/form-library.md](decisions/form-library.md). Does NOT apply to recipe config (Zustand), NodeConfigPanel (`@bnto/nodes`), or code editor (CM6).

- [x] Evaluate form library — Decision: RHF + Zod
- [ ] `packages/@bnto/form` — Create package with auth schemas, `useSignInForm`, `useSignUpForm`
- [ ] `apps/web` — Refactor auth forms to use `@bnto/form` hooks
- [ ] `apps/web` — Migrate future forms (settings/profile) as they're built

### Infra: Shared Test Fixtures Package (`@bnto/test-fixtures`)

**Priority: Low.** Wrap `test-fixtures/` in a TS package with helpers. Currently served by direct file references.

- [ ] `packages/@bnto/test-fixtures` — Create package with TS helpers, add sample CSVs
- [ ] `apps/web` — Update E2E tests to import from shared package

### Security/Performance: File Count Limits & Abuse Guardrails Audit

**Priority: Medium.** Stress-test file count limits per recipe for performance (WASM heap, ZIP generation) and abuse prevention. Document safe boundaries per recipe type.

- [ ] `apps/web` + `engine` — Stress test file counts (50/100/200+ per recipe type), measure memory + processing time
- [ ] `apps/web` — Document recommended limits per recipe, decide enforcement strategy (soft warning vs hard cap vs batching)
- [ ] `apps/web` — UI performance audit at scale (FileCard grid, BouncyStagger, responsive layout)
- [ ] `@bnto/core` — Profile `createZipBlob` memory limits for large batches
- [ ] `.claude/strategy/` — Write `file-limits.md` with results and decisions

### Engine: Spreadsheet Node Template Resolution — M3/M4 (Go engine)

**Milestone: M3/M4.** Go engine work — not blocking M1 (browser execution uses Rust/JS, not Go). The `clean-csv` predefined Bnto fails in cloud execution. The `read-csv` node (type: `spreadsheet`) receives `<no value>` for its input file path template variable.

**Discovered via:** Integration E2E test. All image-based pipelines work — only the spreadsheet node path is broken.

- [ ] `engine` — Reproduce locally: `bnto run` with `clean-csv` fixture against a test CSV file
- [ ] `engine` — Debug template resolution in `spreadsheet` node's `Execute()`
- [ ] `engine` — Fix template variable resolution so `read-csv` receives the actual file path
- [ ] `engine` — Verify fix: E2E `clean-csv` test passes (`task e2e`)

### Engine: Loop Node Output Collection — M3/M4 (Go engine)

**Milestone: M3/M4.** Go engine work — not blocking M1. The `loop` node currently collects original items, not sub-node outputs.

**Impact:** The `rename-csv-columns` fixture is a read → write pass-through. True column remapping requires this fix.

- [ ] `engine` — Loop node collects sub-node outputs instead of (or in addition to) original items
- [ ] `engine` — Alternative: new array-level transform node that operates on all rows at once

### Engine: `pdf` Node Type — M3/M4 (Go engine)

**Milestone: M3/M4.** Go engine work. Required for the PDF to Images Bnto (Tier 2, 50K+ monthly searches).

- [ ] `engine` — Implement `pdf` node type (wrap `pdfcpu` Go library, or shell-command + ghostscript as interim)
- [ ] `engine` — Unit tests for PDF → image conversion
- [ ] `engine` — Integration fixture: `pdf-to-images.bnto.json`

### Infra: Clean Up Convex Dev Environment (Better Auth Remnants)

Convex dev (`zealous-canary-422`) has stale Better Auth records and test artifacts. Write a one-off cleanup mutation.

- [ ] `@bnto/backend` — Audit tables, write cleanup mutation (orphaned auth records, test users, stale executions)
- [ ] `@bnto/backend` — Run against dev, verify table health
- [ ] `@bnto/backend` — (If needed) Run against production

### Infra: Configure R2 Lifecycle Rules — M4 (cloud execution)

**Milestone: M4.** R2 is only used for cloud (server-side) execution. Not needed for M1 browser execution.

| Bucket | Prefix | Auto-delete after |
|---|---|---|
| `bnto-transit` + `bnto-transit-dev` | `uploads/` | 1 hour |
| `bnto-transit` + `bnto-transit-dev` | `executions/` | 24 hours |

- [ ] `infra` — Configure R2 lifecycle rules in Cloudflare dashboard (prod + dev buckets)

### Infra: Domain Setup (bnto.io Custom Domains)

Web app domain (`bnto.io`) delivered in Sprint 2C. API domain (`api.bnto.io`) deferred to M4.

- [x] `infra` — Connect `bnto.io` to Vercel + Cloudflare DNS, verify auth redirects — Delivered in Sprint 2C
- [ ] `infra` — (M4) Add `api.bnto.io` CNAME → Railway, configure custom domain, update `GO_API_URL`

### Infra: Graduate SEO Validation from E2E to Unit Tests

**Priority: Medium.** Graduate SEO validation from slow E2E to unit tests (metadata, registry↔sitemap sync). Keep thin E2E for noindex/redirect/404. Lighthouse CI already delivered (Sprint 3 Wave 1 — GitHub Actions workflow + `task seo:audit`).

- [ ] `apps/web` — Move metadata validation to unit tests (`bntoRegistry.test.ts`)
- [x] `apps/web` — ~~Add Lighthouse CI with `seo: 90` threshold~~ — Delivered in Sprint 3 Wave 1: `.github/workflows/lighthouse.yml` + `lighthouserc.json` + `task seo:audit`
- [ ] `apps/web` — Slim E2E to redirects + 404 + noindex only

### Testing: Standardize E2E Selectors on data-testid

Current E2E tests mix CSS classes, `getByRole`, `getByText`, and `data-testid`. Standardize on `data-testid` for state detection and element targeting. Keep semantic selectors for accessibility assertions.

- [ ] `apps/web` — Audit E2E specs, add `data-testid` attributes, update selectors

### Testing: Concurrent Quota Race Condition — M4/M5 (server-side quotas)

**Milestone: M4/M5.** Quota enforcement only applies to server-side bntos. Browser bntos are free unlimited. This race condition matters when server-side execution has limits.

- [ ] `@bnto/core` — Integration test: fire 2+ concurrent `startPredefined` calls for a user at limit-1 runs, verify at most 1 succeeds
- [ ] `@bnto/backend` — If race confirmed, investigate Convex transaction isolation guarantees or atomic increment patterns

### UX: Per-File Format Override for Convert Image Format

**Priority: Medium.** Per-file format override on `convert-image-format` FileCards. Touches UI (inline Select), state (per-file config map in Zustand), and engine (per-file config passthrough).

- [ ] `apps/web` — Per-file format override state + inline Select on FileCard
- [ ] `@bnto/core` — Update `browserExecute` for per-file config overrides
- [ ] `engine` — Verify Rust WASM supports per-file format params

### Auth: Enable OAuth Social Providers

Google and Discord OAuth configured in `convex/auth.ts` but commented out — need OAuth credentials.

- [ ] `@bnto/backend` — Uncomment `socialProviders` in `convex/auth.ts`
- [ ] `@bnto/backend` — Set Google and Discord OAuth credentials in Convex env vars
- [ ] `apps/web` — Add Google and Discord sign-in buttons to `SignInForm`

### Growth: Referral Program — M5+

Referral links with Pro trial or extended history as reward. Open question: exact reward (Pro trial vs extended history vs early access).

- [ ] `@bnto/backend` — `referrals` table + `applyReferral` mutation
- [ ] `@bnto/core` — Referral service/hooks
- [ ] `apps/web` — Referral link generation UI + landing page `?ref=CODE` capture

### UI: Extract Motorway Design System (`@bnto/ui`)

**Trigger: Desktop app (M3).** Extract `apps/web/components/ui/` → `packages/ui/` as `@bnto/ui` (branded **Motorway**). Zero domain knowledge, purely generic design system. Triggered when desktop creates a second consumer.

- [ ] `packages/ui` — Bootstrap package, move primitives + utility layer + CSS tokens
- [ ] `apps/web` — Update imports to `@bnto/ui`
- [ ] `apps/desktop` — Wire `@bnto/ui` as dependency

### Showcase: Radial Light Source Controls

**Priority: Low (fun polish).** Replace linear slider on `/showcase` with radial + elevation controls for light source direction/height.

- [ ] `apps/web` — `RadialSlider` generic UI component (circular drag input, configurable labels)
- [ ] `apps/web` — Light elevation control → `--light-elevation` CSS variable
- [ ] `apps/web` — Wire into surface shadow system, replace `LightSourceSlider` on showcase

### Performance: WASM Bundle Size & Processing Benchmarks

**Deferred from Sprint 2B.** WASM bundle: 1.6MB raw / 606KB gzipped. ~20% above 500KB target. Not blocking M1.

- [ ] `engine` — Profile bundle size per crate, evaluate code splitting vs single bundle
- [ ] `apps/web` — Processing speed + memory benchmarks per node type

### Performance: Next.js Server Component Audit (Pre-Launch)

**Priority: Pre-launch.** Audit `"use client"` directives — push boundaries down to smallest leaf, convert parents to Server Components, lazy load modals/below-fold with `next/dynamic`.

**Known issues from dashboard page work (Sprint 3):**
- `app/(app)/my-recipes/page.tsx` uses `dynamic()` with `ssr: false` for all data-dependent components (UsageStats, WorkflowGrid, RecentExecutions). This is an anti-pattern — it means null render during SSR → loading fallback after hydration → skeleton → data (triple-jump). The page should be restructured: page.tsx as a Server Component composing small client leaves that each handle their own loading states. Only the Convex-dependent leaf components need `"use client"`.
- Skeleton dimensions were manually aligned to prevent layout shift but the root cause is the SSR gap from `ssr: false`. With proper Server Component structure, static parts (heading, tab list) render immediately in HTML, and only data-fetching leaves show skeletons.
- `AppShell.Content` needed `min-h-[80svh]` as a band-aid to prevent footer visibility during the SSR→hydration gap. This should become unnecessary once pages use proper Server Component composition.
- Same pattern likely exists on other `(app)` routes — audit all `dynamic({ ssr: false })` usage.

- [ ] `apps/web` — Inventory `"use client"` files, refactor candidates to Server Components
- [ ] `apps/web` — Restructure `my-recipes/page.tsx` — Server Component page with client leaf islands (eliminate `ssr: false` anti-pattern)
- [ ] `apps/web` — Audit all `dynamic({ ssr: false })` usage, replace with proper server/client composition
- [ ] `apps/web` — Eliminate barrel imports in client components, lazy load heavy components
- [ ] `apps/web` — Run Lighthouse / bundle analyzer before and after, confirm no regression

### Infra: Vercel Preview Deployment Verification

**Deferred from Sprint 2A Wave 5.** Verify auth flow end-to-end on Vercel preview deployment. Not blocking M1 browser execution.

- [ ] `apps/web` — Verify auth flow on Vercel preview deployment (cookie behavior, proxy redirects, sign-in/sign-out)

### UX: Conversion Hook Messaging Audit — M2/M5

**M2 (Sprint 3) for hook UX, M5 (Sprint 7) for Stripe.** Value-driven conversion hooks (Save, History, Premium Bntos, Team) — no "limit reached" messaging for browser bntos.

- [ ] `@bnto/backend` — Separate browser (no limits) from server-side (quota) error paths
- [ ] `apps/web` — Design conversion hook components with value-driven CTAs

### UX: Execution Activity Feed — M2 (Sprint 3)

**Updated from "Animated Run Counter."** With browser-first, there's no run limit to count down. Instead, show an activity feed / recent executions indicator that reinforces the value of signing up (persistence, history).

- [ ] `apps/web` — Design activity indicator for bnto tool pages (recent executions, total runs)
- [ ] `apps/web` — For anonymous users: "You've run 12 bntos this session. Sign up to save your history."
- [ ] `apps/web` — For authenticated users: animated activity feed with execution count and last-run status

### Premium: Cloud Drive Export (Post-MVP) — M5+

Pro users auto-save results to Google Drive/OneDrive/Dropbox — removes the "download then upload" friction.

- [ ] `apps/web` — "Save to..." post-execution UX
- [ ] `apps/api` — OAuth integration for cloud drive providers
- [ ] `@bnto/backend` — Store connected drive credentials (Pro only)

### Recursive Workflow Composability (Web App)

The Go engine supports recursive `Definition.Nodes`. The web app must preserve this composability. Guard rails (not new tasks — apply when building related features):

- Config panels must work at any nesting depth
- Execution progress must be recursive (group nodes show children's progress)
- JSON editor must represent recursive structure faithfully
- Visual editor (Sprint 4) must support drill-down into group nodes
